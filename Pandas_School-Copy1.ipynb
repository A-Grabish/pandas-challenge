    "    (1) The first and most obvious trend found in the data deals with school size and type.  Small and Medium sized schools had virtually identical scores in all measured statitics, while Large schools did much worse.  The drop in average test score between Small or Medium schools and Large schools was over six points in math and 3 points in reading.  This translated into a coresponding drop in percentage of students passing math and reading.  15% more Large school students failed reading, and 27% more Large schools students failed math compared to their Small and Medium school counterparts.  It is worth noting that all school in the Large category are District schools and had the largest per student spending, while all schools in the Small and Medium categories are Charter schools.\n",

    "    (2)  Students success in Mathmatics suffered more across the previously mentioned devide more than Reading.  While testing scores of both disciplines were lower in Large/Discrtict schools that other schools, Mathematics score dropped more than twice as much in these Large/District schools as did Reading.  This translated into an larger decrease in the percentage of students passing math (27%) than reading (16%).  While Large school testing scores in both areas are disappointing, the failure of so many students in Math means these departments need the most work, and should be given particular attention.\n",
