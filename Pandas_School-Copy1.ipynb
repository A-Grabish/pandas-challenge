    "1.  The first and most obvious trend found in the data deals with school size and type.  \n",
    "Small and Medium sized schools had virtually identical scores in all measured statistics, while Large schools did much worse.  The drop in average test score between Small or Medium schools and Large schools was over six points in math and 3 points in reading.  This translated into a corresponding drop in percentage of students passing math and reading.  15% more Large school students failed reading, and 27% more Large school students failed math compared to their Small and Medium school counterparts.  \n",
    "    - It is worth noting that all schools in the Large category are District schools and had the largest per student spending, while all schools in the Small and Medium categories are Charter schools.\n",
    "    <br/>\n",
    "2.  Students success in Mathematics suffered more across the previously mentioned divide more than Reading.  While testing scores of both disciplines were lower in Large/District schools that other schools, Mathematics scores dropped more than twice as much in these Large/District schools as Reading did.  This translated into a larger decrease in the percentage of students passing math (27%) than reading (16%).  While Large school testing scores in both areas are disappointing, the failure of so many students in Math means these departments need the most work and should be given particular attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Finally, testing scores and percentage of students passing, whether math or reading, was relatively stable across grades (i.e., 9th through 12th) within any given school.  This suggests that the problems in Large/District schools are not confined to only sections of the schools but can be found in every level.  To find out the exact cause, more data would need to be gathered as there is no mention of class size or number of educators per school, nor whether there is any measurable difference between the two types of schools are populated with students.\n",
